If you consent to the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this may limit your ability to use certain features of our services</p>
          <p>We use GPS technology to determine your current location as well as the location of our drivers to make it easier to get a ride whenever you need one. Location data helps improve our services, including pick up times, drop off times, navigation, and customer support.</p>
          <p>Specifically, Mybuggy collects location data when the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of your mobile device. Mybuggy collects this data from the time a ride is requested until it is finished. We use this data to enhance your experience on our Platform as well as our Service, enable safety features, and prevent and detect fraud.</p>
          <p>“[This app, MyBuggy] collects location data to enable ["Driver's current location to send ride request"], ["give ride request nearby driver"], & ["company wants to send promotional messages to the drivers for a certain area"] even when the app is closed or not in use.”</p>

That said, you have the choice to either enable or disallow such collections through the settings on your mobile device.</p>
          <h2 className={h2}>SMS and Call log permissions</h2>
          <p>We use SMS based OTP verification codes for account creation or log-ins for security and safety purposes</p>
          <h2 className={h2}>Payments</h2>
